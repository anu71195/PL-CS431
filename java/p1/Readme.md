### Problem Statement (Completed)

#### Sock Matching

There is a heap of new labelled socks. Each sock is having one of four colours: white, black, blue and grey. There are several robotic arms which can pick up a single sock at a time and pass it to a matching machine. The matching machine is able to find two socks of the same colour and pass the pair of socks to a shelf manager robot. The shelf manager robot then puts the pair of socks to the appropriate shelf.

Write a java program to simulate the sock sorting system.
